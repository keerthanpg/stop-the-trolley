                    California Autonomous Driving Test Statistics 2019</a>
                <p class="col-xs-10 col-md-8 explanation">
                    <br>The CA DMV, on Feb 9th, 2021
                    released a batch of reports filed by multiple companies
                    testing autonomous cars in the bay area. All companies testing autonomous cars on public
                    roads are required to report statistics and details related to miles driven and disengagements,
                    otherwise known as human-takeovers. The batch of data visualized here corresponds to the period
                    spanning Dec 1, 2019 to Nov 30, 2020.
                    <br> <br>

                    While the statistics are useful to look at large scale trends, they cannot be taken as an
                    apples-to-apples comparison between companies. In addition to the fact that various companies are
                    targeting different markets and business models, miles per disengagement is a
                    faulty approximation of maturity of the system since the numbers are affected by where companies drive,
                    the difficulty of driving scenarios cars are tested in, which disengagements are considered valid for
                    reporting by each company, etc. For example, it is widely known in the industry that many companies drive 
                    long stretches of highways to collect easy miles because highways aren't nearly as hard as urban environments,
                    thereby improving their miles and miles to disengagements ratios.
                    Many companies are also known to reproduce their on-road disengagemnets in simulation and report only if it 
                    reoccurs despite fixing.

                    All of this allows for a wide room of interpretation and as such these numbers should be taken with
                    a self-driven truck load of salt.

                    What we've attempted here is a pure visualization of aggregate reported statistics.
                    <br> <br>

                    Feel free to play around with it and let us know if you spot any inaccuracies. Original data dumps
                    for disengagements can be found

                    Note that here, a car is counted in fleet size only if it clocks at least 1 mile over the entire
                    reporting period and does not account for cars that are registered but have been inactive. <a

                <p class="col-xs-10 col-md-8 explanation-head">Miles, Fleet and Disengagements
                </p>
                <p class="col-xs-10 col-md-8 explanation">
                    Waymo and Cruise alone account for more than half of the total fleets operating in California and 
                    more than three quarters of all miles driven in the state. Also, due to the pandemic, most companies 
                    clocked in fewer miles in 2020 than in 2019 with the exceptions of a few like Apple and Zoox who actually 
                    improved their miles driven. Segmented by month, it can be seen that for most companies, miles driven 
                    almost halved in March 2020 and became practically zero in Apriland May 2020 while
                    local governments advised strict shelter-in-place. Since then driving has picked up but not quite
                    matched pre-covid levels manifesting that across the industry the pandemic has deccelerated the progress of
                    AV testing and development.

            <p class="col-xs-10 col-md-8 explanation">
                Cruise and Waymo are outliers with big fleets and high miles but reasonable number of disengagements. 
                On the other hand Toyota Research and Mercedes-Benz R&D are also outliers for having order of magnitude more
                disengagements for order of magnitude less miles. They could also be orders of magnitude more forthcoming in
                their reporting compared to others. One could also note that Pony and Nuro are clocking in a lot of miles 
                with low disengagements for a comparatively small fleet size.
                <br>
                From the second graph, we can infer that 
                Cruise and Waymo are way ahead in their testing game distantly followed by AutoX, Pony AI and WeRide.

                <p class="col-xs-10 col-md-8 explanation">
                    Interestingly, among the largest players, Cruise has only had 27 reportable disengagements the
                    entire year and
                    around 60% of them are atrributed to “precautionary takeover on account of other road user behaving poorly”. Waymo
                    also reported
                    only 21 disengagements across the year although the reasons they mentioned admit errors of the AV
                    system. Most companies test their technology on roads marked "streets", ie urban areas, while the reporting of 
                    disengagement source (actor) is often arbitrary.

                    While most companies have reduced their total number of disengagements across the two years, 
                    Apple, Zoox, AIMotive and Qualcomm
                    have atually reported more disengagements in 2020 than in 2019. Among these Apple and Zoox have
                    somewhat proportationately increased their total miles as well while the other two drove fewer
                    miles.
                    Waymo, Zoox, Aurora and Apple have increased their active fleet/ cars deployed in California while Cruise, Nuro,
                    Mercedes-Benz
                    and Nvidia have decreased year-on-year.
                    Lyft, Toyota Research, Mercedes-Benz and Nvidia have reported noteworthy decrease in disengagements
                    in 2020 compared to 2019.
                    <br><br>

                    Notoriously, while Tesla is synonymous with ("full" *cough cough*) self-driving in wider media, they also 
                    claim that their system on public roads in California
                    is technically of L2/L3 capability, which is a lower level of autonomy than others listed here and
                    thereby, Tesla is not bound to report testing statistics to the State of California.
                    8 companies that drove non-zero miles in 2019 shut their testing in California in 2020, notable among
                    them being Baidu, and Drive AI which got acquired by Apple. Also, 10 companies that never tested in 
                    California in 2019 now do in 2020, including Argo AI.
